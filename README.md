### **üìÇ Step 2: Set Up Storage Drive and Subscriptions**

1. Open the cloud storage service where you want to save the downloaded Instagram stories (**Google Drive or OneDrive**).
2. **Ensure that there is no existing folder named **`Instagram Stories`** in the root directory** of your Drive.
3. **Edit the subscriptions file before uploading it to Drive**:
   - Open `repo-folder/Upload to Drive/subscriptions.txt`.
   - Add the usernames of the Instagram accounts you want to download stories from.
   - The format should be:
     ```
     bbcnews 16278726
     twicetagram 2107411892
     ```
   - The number beside the username (after a space) is the **Instagram user ID**.

## Background and Inspiration:

I was in high school when I used to download Instagram stories of some of my celeb crushes. Then I found [AutoFetcher-IG-Stories-to-GDrive](https://github.com/chriskyfung/AutoFetcher-IG-Stories-to-GDrive) by **Chris K.Y. Fung**. It worked wonderfully and helped me so much. But with Instagram's increasing security and robot detection, my account used to get restricted for using it.

At last, I made my own downloader. **Chris is the single biggest inspiration for this project** üòä (He also helped me a lot in making this) üòÉ.
