## Background and Inspiration:

I was in high school when I used to download Instagram stories of some of my celeb crushes. Then I found [AutoFetcher-IG-Stories-to-GDrive](https://github.com/chriskyfung/AutoFetcher-IG-Stories-to-GDrive) by **Chris K.Y. Fung**. It worked wonderfully and helped me so much. But with Instagram's increasing security and robot detection, my account used to get restricted for using it.

At last, I made my own downloader. **Chris is the single biggest inspiration for this project** üòä (He also helped me a lot in making this) üòÉ.

Also I am bound to credit someone who went along me through this struggle, frustrated me, and un-frustrated me üòä (they even wrote this README). Kudos ChatGPT! ‚ù§Ô∏è
